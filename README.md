# Smart survey on recent trends in water level, drought and water quality analysis system

Over 200 million yearly reports of diseases identified with scarce water and sanitation conditions, 5-10 million deaths occurred worldwide. Water quality checking has subsequently gotten important to supply clean and safe water. This survey work depicts the fundamental explanation behind the requirement for robust and productive Water level, Drought, and water quality control in the level framework, which will keep human assets healthy, sustainable and diminish water use for household purposes. Climate change and variability have so many significant impacts caused by the natural environment's water system. Incredible methods, collection of water samples are tested alone and analyzed in water laboratories. However, it is not always easy to capture, analyze, and rapidly disseminate information to relevant users to make timely and well-informed decisions. The review work encompasses traditional methods based on Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approaches.

### What's the problem?

Over 200 million yearly reports of diseases identified with scarce water and sanitation conditions, 5-10 million deaths occurred worldwide. Water quality checking has subsequently gotten important to supply clean and safe water. This survey work depicts the fundamental explanation behind the requirement for robust and productive Water level, Drought, and water quality control in the level framework, which will keep human assets healthy, sustainable and diminish water use for household purposes. Climate change and variability have so many significant impacts caused by the natural environment's water system. Incredible methods, collection of water samples are tested alone and analyzed in water laboratories. However, it is not always easy to capture, analyze, and rapidly disseminate information to relevant users to make timely and well-informed decisions. The review work encompasses traditional methods based on Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approaches.

### How can technology help?

From intelligent solutions for Machine Learning (ML), technology can make a significant impact on the availability of water and its consumption.Â 

Additional ways Water Management as a Service can help:

- Creating a database and [interactive map](https://wmaasp.mybluemix.net/sensor-overview) to help locate and maintain the water points across the counties
- Collecting water usage, breakage, and repair data from boreholes that are monitored by SweetSense
- Delivering tickets to repair and maintenance teams who can respond to failures and repair the boreholes

### The idea

To encourage optimal water choices by consumers and local governments and to incentivize water sustainability, we propose devising and implementing an API for water data collection and dissemination. With an API, you could have a centralized way to:

- Query geolocations of sustainable water sources
- Simplify coordination and funding for water construction projects
- Explore educational tools to support water sustainability and clean water access
- Enable transparent water usage, cleanliness results, and site-to-site comparison
- Access plain language case studies and legislation

### Solution ideas

This section provides several examples that you and your team can use to jump-start your solution ideas. The following ideas are examples only, so feel free to brainstorm with your team to create your own original ideas and solutions. For example, the 2020 Call for Code Grand Prize winner, [Agrolly](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/agrolly/) created a solution that uses IBM Cloud Object Storage, IBM Watson Studio, IBM Watson Assistant, and The Weather Company technologies to execute climate risk assessments, which allows farmers with less resources available to them to still make more educated decisions, obtain the necessary financing, and improve their economic outcome.
